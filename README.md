Poc python implementation of the paper "Zero Knowledge Proofs of Elliptic Curve Inner Products from Principal Divisors and Weil Reciprocity" by Liam Eagen  
https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/596.pdf

Goal is to delegate elliptic curve scalar multiplications, to be used in circuits such as Cairo.

Useful resources are located in section 3 of the "Pairings for beginners" paper by Craig Costello : https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fdbb09f31d71c1227082339/t/5ff394720493bd28278889c6/1609798774687/PairingsForBeginners.pdf

This is a work in progress and highly experimental.
